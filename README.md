### What's New:
- **UI Screenshots Section**: Added a section to showcase the user interface with placeholders for images (replace `./path/to/screenshot-*` with actual image paths in your repository).
- The screenshots will help users visualize what the app looks like, making it more engaging and easier to understand.

Make sure to include the images in your repository (you can store them in a `/assets/` folder or similar directory) and update the image paths accordingly.

Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
